 Model A:
- Radio Button: It would have been easier if labels were included for the radio buttons. Labels improve clarity and usability.
- Checkbox (Advanced Settings): The checkbox in the advanced settings is not working as expected.



 Model B:
- Radio Button: The radio buttons are not functional.
- Checkbox: The checkboxes are not functional.



 Model C:
- Save Settings Button: The "Save Settings" button could have been improved in terms of design or visibility.
- Slider: The slider works, but it would be more user-friendly if it had a label to represent its value, improving the user's understanding of the setting.
- Radio Button: The radio button is not working.
- Radio Button Labels: There are no labels for the radio buttons, which could confuse users.
- Advanced Settings: Missing advanced settings option.



 Model D:
- Radio Button: The radio button is not functional.



 Preference Explanation:

- Model D falls slightly behind Model C in terms of UI, specifically with the spacing between elements, but Model D fulfills the need for advanced settings as required by the user prompt.
